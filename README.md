# python-api-challenge
module 6 challenge
In this challenge, we looked at sets of data from the open weather API and the geoapify API. 
For the open weather data, we took a list of cities and looked at the relationship of latitude to several other weather measurements. 
In the second exercise, using the Geoapify API, we mapped cities on the map and also located hotels near these cities.
